        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Coding or programming is the process of creating instructions for computers using programming languages. 
            Coding is used to program the websites, apps, and other technologies we interact with every day.Computer coding is the use of computer programming 
            languages to give computers and machines instructions on what actions to perform. It is the way humans communicate with machines, and it allows us t
            o create software like programs, operating systems, and mobile apps.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by 
            Sun Microsystems in 1995. There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, 
            and more are created every day. Java is fast, secure, and reliable. From laptops to datacenters, game consoles to scientific 
            supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere! Java allows you to play online games, chat with people around 
            world, calculate your mortgage interest, and view images in 3D, just to name a few. It's also integral to the intranet applications 
            and othe    r e-business solutions that are the foundation of corporate computing.

        <p class="sectionTag text-big"><b>What is Python?</b></p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. 
            Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for 
            Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. 
            Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. 
            Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the 
            extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely 
            distributed.

        <p class="sectionTag text-big"><b>What is HTML?</p></b></p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications.

            HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesnâ€™t have the ability to create dynamic functionality. Instead, it makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.
            
            When working with HTML, we use simple code structures (tags and attributes) to mark up a website page.
